# Wines API

This API powers the https://github.dev/react-bootcamp reboot for 2024. 

This API is used to manage a toy wines app. You can use it to retrieve wine regions, wines by regions, comments and likes on individual wines.

This API is open to everyone and is available on [https://${environment.HOST}/api](https://${environment.HOST}/api)

## Fetch all wine regions

If you want to try the API, you can retrieve all wines regions just like that:

curl -X GET https://${environment.HOST}/api/regions | jq

[
  "Bordeaux",
  "Bourgogne",
  "Champagne",
  "Languedoc",
  "Loire",
  "Normandie"
]
```

## Fetch wines from a region

then you can get all the wines from a specific region like :

```sh
curl -X GET https://${environment.HOST}/api/wines?region=Bordeaux | jq
